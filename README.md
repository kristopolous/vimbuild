This is my custom script to build vim on some random box that I need
to develop from.  It's constantly changing on an as-needed basis.

To install, just run

    ./install.sh

Screenshots ... everyone loves screen shots

[acidx](https://github.com/kristopolous/acidx) is also used above.

### some notes

I've been using vim since about 1997. I don't use pathogen because I don't see why anyone would want that. I also don't use easymove or spark or git gutter or anything by tpope.

So if you are looking for some souped-up tricked-out rice-rocket of a vim, you should go elsewhere.

But if you are looking for one that some guy that codes in about 4-6 languages a day uses every day, then here you go.
