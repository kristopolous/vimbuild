This is an old vim set up that I was using going back many decades. 

I've been switching to nvim and the cosmic lazyvim, lunarvim, astrovim 
... these are all dangerous and wreckless tools with annoying things that
slow me down.

Here's some things this doesn't have:

 * linters that wildly and incorrectly guess what it thinks your problems are.
 * auto-formatters that fuck up your code whenever you write a file, destroying your git history and breaking shit.
 * time-wasting animations that waste your time dancing around the screen as if you don't have shit to do.
