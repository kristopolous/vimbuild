This is my custom script to build vim on some random box that I need
to develop from.  It's constantly changing on an as-needed basis.

To install, just run

    ./install.sh

orrrr

    curl https://raw.github.com/kristopolous/vimbuild/master/easyinstall.sh | sh

Screenshots ... everyone loves screen shots

[acidx](https://github.com/kristopolous/acidx) is also used above.

### some notes

I've been using vim since about 1997. I don't use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). I also don't use [EasyMotion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3526) or [Sparkup](https://github.com/rstacruz/sparkup) or [Git Gutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) or anything by [tpope](https://github.com/tpope). Not that I have anything against these things, I just don't use them.

So if you are looking for some souped-up tricked-out rice-rocket of a vim, you should go elsewhere.
